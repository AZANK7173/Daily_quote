# Daily_quote
Code that print a random daily quote from a txt file of quotes.

In order to make it print in the terminal right after you open it, you just need to open your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` depending on the terminal and run the code by acessing with `nano ~/.bashrc` (or any code editor you like). 

Inside the file, add in the final lines the code `python path_to_daily_quote_file/daily_quote.py`. Restart the terminal and then you are ready to go!
